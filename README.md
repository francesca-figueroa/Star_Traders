## Repo Organization
------

The contents of the Star Traders game is contained within the "Star Traders" folder, organized by Unreal. 
Outside of the Star Traders is all of the Documentation required by CSCI 3308, this includes: 
* Testing cases
* Final Presentation
* Final Submission
* Game Credits 


## Play The Game 
------
To play, first copy the repo of the group GitHub using the command: 
	
git clone https://github.com/francesca-figueroa/Star_Traders.git

Once the repo has been cloned you simply run the executable file and play the game. 


## Description
------

   Start Traders is a desktop trading game, in space. The game opens on a grid of hex-tiles, on which several solar systems spawn. 
   The player's role is to buy and sell within a solar system during the course of a turn. The goal of the game is to make money! 

   
## Vision Statement
------

  We strive to make games we would enjoy playing.
  
## Motivation
------

  
  In initial planning we determined we all liked games, feeling other options to be less interesting we decided to make a game. We considered a number of different topics, formats, and genres for our games, and through brainstorming, eventually concluded that we would enjoy making and playing a game like this project. 
  
## Risks
------


  1. Time management will be a difficulty as is with any team-based project. We will have to work to coordinate our schedules and individually and as a group manage our limited time resources effectively to generate a good end product, considering the scope of this project. Failure to manage our time effectively would result in ending up with an incomplete product, because we hadn't managed our time and wasted time.
  2. Communication is also a difficulty in team-based work, especially in this case where a significant piece of the project is learning how to effectively use project management tools like Github and Trello. Failure to do this would slow and harm our product and our productivity.
  3. Finding an engine that best suits our needs may prove to be difficult. It is possible that, if we choose unwisely, that we may encounter unforseen issues or will be unable to achieve our goals as originally planned. 
  4. Designing or finding suitable art is another consideration we will have to take into account. Visuals can make or break a game, so if we are unable obtain artwork, the quality of our game could suffer. 
  

## Mitigation Strategy
------


  1. The use of Trello for scheduling and a set weekly meeting time will help to greatly reduce the risk in time management. 
  2. Group text is already in effect and the use of email is a strong backup. Beyond that, Trello and GitHub will serve as another possible backup. 
  3. We have listed both pros and cons to a number of suitable engines after a vote and extensive discussion we have decided on the Unreal Engine 4, as it is free, uses C++, and has Git integration, three things that make it the most attractive option.
  4. Our game design has been designed to minimize risk because in space there is a lot of empty space and simple shapes, thus less need for complex graphics and competent art skill.
